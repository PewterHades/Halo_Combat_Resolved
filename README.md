# Halo Combat Program

This program was made to make combat in the "Halo Mythic" TTRPG more streamlined.

## Features
- Ability to easily input weapon and enemy values 
- The program does all of the calcualtions itself and gives relevant information like the roll, hit location, damage, debuffs
- Allows for the enemy to dodge each individual shot and will reduce thier Agility respectivly
- Takes into account the fire type you are using and if you are using a gun or melee
- Has different variables if you are attacking an enemy, an enemie's shields, or a vehicle
- Follows the rules from the Mythic 7.0 Rules book

## Disclaimer
- This is my first real project made public, most of my coding up to this point has either been for classwork or small personal things, so don't be suprized if some of the more formal things (like this) are not done super well
- My friends were the ones who got me to make this public so thank them
